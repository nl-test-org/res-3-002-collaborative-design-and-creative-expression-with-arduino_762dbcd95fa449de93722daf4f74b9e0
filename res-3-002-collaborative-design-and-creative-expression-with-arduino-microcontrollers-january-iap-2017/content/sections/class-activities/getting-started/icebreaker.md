transcript: '<p><span m=''15350''>KYLE KEANE: So today, we''re going to do something</span>
  <span m=''18860''>where we talk about our name.</span> </p><p><span m=''23810''>Renew
  icebreakery thing for like 15--</span> <span m=''26492''>well, no, there''s a lot
  of people--</span> <span m=''27950''>20 minutes.</span> </p><p><span m=''30150''>Name,
  what brought you here.</span> </p><p><span m=''35990''>And, oh yeah, right off the
  bat I''ll say the more you all talk,</span> <span m=''38970''>the less I talk.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''40040''>So you''ll get sick of my voice, I promise.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''42420''>I am very monotonous at times.</span> </p><p><span m=''44990''>And so,
  the more you guys participate by saying words,</span> <span m=''47900''>the less
  you have to hear my voice.</span> </p><p><span m=''50100''>So I would like three
  things that we would</span> <span m=''53670''>like to know about each other.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''57630''>So if you could say--</span> <span m=''60970''>I need three
  more bullet points about things</span> <span m=''63239''>that we''re going to say.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''66774''>This is the moment where you talk,</span> <span m=''68190''>otherwise
  I just have a compulsion.</span> </p><p><span m=''70142''>I want to hear my voice
  constantly,</span> <span m=''71600''>that''s why I''m in front of a classroom.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''73360''>AUDIENCE: Favorite video game.</span> </p><p><span m=''74630''>KYLE
  KEANE: Favorite video game.</span> </p><p><span m=''75620''>Cool.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''76120''>Oh, that''s so well-themed.</span> </p><p><span m=''78470''>Nice.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''79300''>All right.</span> </p><p><span m=''81410''>No, honestly.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''82260''>We had one-handed food during the seminar I was teaching,</span>
  <span m=''85310''>but, yeah, favorite video game is really on point.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''91300''>I can write, I promise.</span> </p><p><span m=''93259''>There we go.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''96170''>All right, favorite video game.</span> </p><p><span m=''102970''>I
  can do this.</span> </p><p><span m=''103810''>AUDIENCE: Programming background?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''105300''>KYLE KEANE: Programming background, sure.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''108880''>Do we want to know languages or--</span> <span m=''112848''>AUDIENCE:
  Either languages, amount of rough--</span> <span m=''115038''>amount of experience.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''116050''>Things like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''117496''>KYLE
  KEANE: All right.</span> </p><p><span m=''128590''>So something about your general
  level of experience.</span> </p><p><span m=''134000''>And if you have nothing to
  say about that,</span> <span m=''136510''>then just say [INAUDIBLE]--</span> <span
  m=''140520''>and that''s perfectly fine.</span> </p><p><span m=''143000''>That gives
  us a good read on what''s happening there.</span> </p><p><span m=''146800''>One
  more bullet point.</span> </p><p><span m=''147886''>Are these called bullet points
  when they''re dashes?</span> </p><p><span m=''150010''>Maybe they''re just called
  dashes.</span> </p><p><span m=''151403''>AUDIENCE: Close enough.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''152090''>KYLE KEANE: Falsima, was it?</span> </p><p><span m=''153372''>AUDIENCE:
  Close enough.</span> </p><p><span m=''154329''>KYLE KEANE: Close enough.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''155371''>Oh, yes, that''s good.</span> </p><p><span m=''156629''>AUDIENCE:
  You can call them bullets-- squashed bullets.</span> </p><p><span m=''158920''>KYLE
  KEANE: Squashed bullets--</span> <span m=''160170''>I like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''160820''>All right.</span> </p><p><span m=''161320''>One more fun thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''162625''>AUDIENCE: How about what you might do with Unity?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''165520''>KYLE KEANE: Cool.</span> </p><p><span m=''166228''>All
  right.</span> </p><p><span m=''166728''>What do you want to do?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''167690''>Well, if you think that that''s different than what</span> <span m=''169773''>brought
  you here.</span> </p><p><span m=''171296''>AUDIENCE: All right, fair enough.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''172670''>KYLE KEANE: Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m=''172980''>All
  right.</span> </p><p><span m=''173780''>I like it, but all right, so--</span> <span
  m=''176079''>the vision for the type of game.</span> </p><p><span m=''177520''>Because
  some of you may have come with this,</span> <span m=''179353''>oh my god, I have
  this amazing side scroller</span> <span m=''181300''>that involves pajamas and bed
  sheets.</span> </p><p><span m=''184750''>So you can feel free to share that here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''187740''>What type of game or what you want to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''200060''>I know that it''s way too small, but that''s all right.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''202579''>We''ll get it from example, once each other starts sharing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''205484''>AUDIENCE: Where you''re from.</span> </p><p><span m=''206651''>KYLE
  KEANE: Where you''re from--</span> <span m=''207942''>I love that one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''208610''>There''s so many fun things--</span> <span m=''209776''>I''m from Southern
  California.</span> </p><p><span m=''211550''>And when I was in Southern California,</span>
  <span m=''213850''>most people were from Southern California.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''215600''>But now that I am in Cambridge, I get so excited.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''218090''>I''m like, that person--</span> <span m=''219440''>I had a freshman
  in my seminar this year</span> <span m=''221810''>that was from my neighboring city
  in Southern California.</span> </p><p><span m=''224210''>It was so exciting.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''225731''>All right.</span> </p><p><span m=''226230''>So--</span>
  <span m=''226579''>AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m=''227590''>KYLE KEANE: It
  is Chino Hills, California,</span> <span m=''230220''>which is a tiny weird little
  city that is not really</span> <span m=''233630''>connected to many other cities.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''235707''>AUDIENCE: Near LA, I''m guessing.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''237040''>KYLE KEANE: It''s in-between LA and San</span> <span m=''238940''>Diego
  and out into the desert.</span> </p>'
