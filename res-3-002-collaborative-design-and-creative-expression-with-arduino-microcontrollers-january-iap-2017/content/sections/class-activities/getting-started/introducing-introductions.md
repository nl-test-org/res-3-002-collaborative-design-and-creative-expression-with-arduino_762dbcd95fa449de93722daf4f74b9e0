title: Introducing Introductions
transcript: '<p><span m=''14884''>KYLE KEANE: All right.</span> </p><p><span m=''15800''>So
  on a scale of zero to 10, how energetic is everyone feeling?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''22599''>I''m going to count to three and then-- hey,</span> <span m=''24390''>is
  that a super familiar face?</span> </p><p><span m=''27200''>Hey.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''28880''>Howdy.</span> </p><p><span m=''30700''>Yeah, so on the count of three,
  I</span> <span m=''33380''>want everyone to say a number between zero and 10</span>
  <span m=''36080''>about how much energy you''re feeling about being here today.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''41316''>So I don''t want to project.</span> </p><p><span m=''42440''>I''m
  feeling a little bit low energy.</span> </p><p><span m=''44266''>So I don''t want
  to project.</span> </p><p><span m=''45390''>So if you guys feel good, tell me</span>
  <span m=''46765''>you feel good so that I know that my internal state is not</span>
  <span m=''49880''>your state.</span> </p><p><span m=''51380''>It''s really important
  to gauge these things sometimes.</span> </p><p><span m=''53630''>All right.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''54270''>So 1, 2, 3.</span> </p><p><span m=''55850''>[INTERPOSING
  VOICES]</span> <span m=''58250''>KYLE KEANE: All right.</span> </p><p><span m=''59420''>There
  was a gradient in this direction, but all right.</span> </p><p><span m=''63690''>That''s
  good.</span> </p><p><span m=''64190''>Nobody went down to three, which is about
  where I am.</span> </p><p><span m=''66200''>Unless there was any threes out there--
  if there are,</span> <span m=''68150''>come talk to me after.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''69066''>There''s support services.</span> </p><p><span m=''70170''>And we can
  go together and get a little bumped up.</span> </p><p><span m=''74760''>But yeah,
  so again, I want social interaction today.</span> </p><p><span m=''81470''>So we''re
  going to do something quicker than yesterday,</span> <span m=''86010''>but I want
  people to introduce yourself and say</span> <span m=''91085''>a random animal and
  make that animal''s noise if you can,</span> <span m=''94610''>or attempt to.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''96330''>So I''m Kyle and--</span> <span m=''103289''>it doesn''t
  even have to--</span> <span m=''104330''>I''m trying to make it rhyme or have alliteration.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''106982''>Doesn''t even have to be that.</span> </p><p><span m=''108190''>I''m
  going to say Kyle, cat, meow.</span> </p><p><span m=''110930''>That''s most-- OK,
  meow.</span> </p><p><span m=''113450''>That''s more like an actual cat says.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''115000''>That''s not what we represent cats saying.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''117759''>Yeah, so try to look around and figure out</span> <span m=''120560''>people''s
  names and maybe one other thing, something</span> <span m=''124640''>personal about
  us that we can get to know some type of thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''130009''>And
  what''s a good--</span> <span m=''130892''>AUDIENCE: What we want to eat for dinner.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''132600''>KYLE KEANE: Great.</span> </p><p><span m=''132990''>All
  right.</span> </p><p><span m=''133250''>What you''re hoping to have for dinner tonight.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''135166''>Thank you.</span> </p><p><span m=''136550''>All right,
  so Kyle, probably Thai food,</span> <span m=''140564''>but that''s because it''s
  my default</span> <span m=''141980''>and I never know what else to do, so Thai food.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''145250''>All right.</span> </p><p><span m=''145910''>So with you
  guys--</span> <span m=''147759''>AUDIENCE: I''m Mark.</span> </p><p><span m=''148550''>I''m
  probably going to end up having pasta tonight, maybe</span> <span m=''150942''>Soylent.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''151680''>Who knows?</span> </p><p><span m=''152180''>We''ll see.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''152680''>And</span> <span m=''154296''>[INTERPOSING VOICES]</span>
  <span m=''155288''>KYLE KEANE: horrified.</span> </p><p><span m=''158642''>AUDIENCE:
  You really drink Soylent?</span> </p><p><span m=''160121''>AUDIENCE: I survived
  off of that for weeks at a time.</span> </p><p><span m=''162353''>AUDIENCE: Just
  like just Soylent, nothing else?</span> </p><p><span m=''164312''>AUDIENCE: Just
  Soylent.</span> </p><p><span m=''164764''>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m=''165263''>KYLE
  KEANE: Anybody not know what Soylent is?</span> </p><p><span m=''167386''>[INTERPOSING
  VOICES]</span> <span m=''170814''>AUDIENCE: Not Soylent Green.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''171980''>KYLE KEANE: Not Soylent Green.</span> </p><p><span m=''172700''>No.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''173469''>AUDIENCE: It''s like a better version of Ensure.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''175427''>AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''176136''>KYLE
  KEANE: Right.</span> </p><p><span m=''176885''>But it has all the nutrients that
  a human needs to survive.</span> </p><p><span m=''179480''>And you just drink it
  and you never have to worry about food.</span> </p><p><span m=''182560''>But--</span>
  <span m=''183060''>AUDIENCE: It''s easy and it''s cheap.</span> </p><p><span m=''185720''>Those
  are all the requirements a student should--</span> <span m=''189180''>and my favorite
  animal is the prairie dog.</span> </p><p><span m=''191140''>I don''t really know
  what sound they make,</span> <span m=''192848''>but I think it''s like [CLICKING]..</span>
  </p><p><span m=''194510''>KYLE KEANE: Aw.</span> </p><p><span m=''195560''>That
  was nice.</span> </p><p><span m=''198860''>Cool.</span> </p><p><span m=''200040''>All
  right.</span> </p><p><span m=''201140''>Thank you.</span> </p><p><span m=''202790''>So
  today, at some point, you''re going to break up into groups.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''205625''>And at some point, I''m going to do a pop quiz</span> <span m=''207500''>and
  you''re going to have to tell me</span> <span m=''208370''>the names of the people
  in your group,</span> <span m=''210130''>because I forgot to do that yesterday</span>
  <span m=''211766''>and I wonder how many of you know</span> <span m=''213140''>the
  names of the people that were in your group.</span> </p><p><span m=''215710''>I''m
  not going to ask you about yesterday,</span> <span m=''219200''>but today I will
  ask you about that.</span> </p><p><span m=''221930''>So I mean, some of you may
  have known the names.</span> </p><p><span m=''224780''>Thumbs up if you did.</span>
