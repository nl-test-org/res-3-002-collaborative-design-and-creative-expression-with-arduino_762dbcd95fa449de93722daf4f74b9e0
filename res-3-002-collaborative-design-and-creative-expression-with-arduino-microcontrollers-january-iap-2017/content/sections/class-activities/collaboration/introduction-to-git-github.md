title: Introduction to Git/GitHub
transcript: '<p><span m="19770">ANDREW RINGLER: It''s like a file sharing system,</span>
  <span m="21930">like Dropbox, except you manually take care of the files</span>
  <span m="25860">yourself and you worry about merge conflicts.</span></p><p><span
  m="28080">So if in Dropbox, you and your collaborator</span> <span m="31500">added
  a document at the same time, it tries to save both</span> <span m="34920">and it
  goes, aah, something''s wrong.</span></p><p><span m="36750">And it makes one that
  says &quot;conflicted copy.&quot;</span> <span m="39920">And GitHub does a similar
  thing but then it hands it back</span> <span m="45186">to you and it says, I''m
  not going</span> <span m="46560">to save that conflicted copy, you</span> <span
  m="48030">need to tell me what to do to resolve that so that I only</span> <span
  m="51240">have one version of each file and it''s the master version.</span></p><p><span
  m="55080">So GitHub, in a nutshell, is just</span> <span m="57180">a way to share
  files with other people</span> <span m="59190">collaboratively without overwriting
  other people''s</span> <span m="62520">stuff and without having conflicts happen
  inside</span> <span m="65400">of the cloud where you''re able to share this document.</span></p><p><span
  m="68544">So what I''m going to go over today</span> <span m="69960">is GitHub and
  then briefly how to add pages and upload them.</span></p><p><span m="78090">So what
  is GitHub?</span></p><p><span m="81520">Does anyone want to explain what GitHub
  is?</span></p><p><span m="85320">Or Git?</span></p><p><span m="94140">The wild guess.</span></p><p><span
  m="98870">OK.</span></p><p><span m="101670">GitHub is a few things.</span></p><p><span
  m="104690">GitHub is a web-based platform, a website for sharing code,</span> <span
  m="115770">sharing software code--</span> <span m="117250">the source code of software.</span></p><p><span
  m="120030">So it''s created for developers to collaborate on code.</span></p><p><span
  m="126210">A lot of code on there is open source code--</span> <span m="129570">code
  that the source code is freely available to look at.</span></p><p><span m="138130">So
  basically, it''s a website where</span> <span m="139560">you can navigate other
  people''s code,</span> <span m="144120">you can collaborate on the same project.</span></p><p><span
  m="152192">And you can also just look at other people''s projects</span> <span m="155485">so
  you can submit bug reports to projects.</span></p><p><span m="164370">So GitHub
  is the sort of community.</span></p><p><span m="170200">The other thing it is is
  it''s a piece of software</span> <span m="172950">based on a technology called Git,</span>
  <span m="176270">G-I-T. Git is a piece of software that</span> <span m="186120">lets
  you collaborate, basically lets you share source code.</span></p><p><span m="193970">And
  GitHub kind of extends that by making a pretty website</span> <span m="198920">and
  a few other things.</span></p><p><span m="209130">So Git is a piece of software
  called version control.</span></p><p><span m="213145">Has anyone heard that term
  before?</span></p><p><span m="217820">Yes?</span></p><p><span m="218977">Does anyone
  want to explain that term-- version control?</span></p><p><span m="225850">It is
  a very fancy way of saying keeping a history</span> <span m="230860">and storing
  multiple versions of things.</span></p><p><span m="233760">So for example, say,
  you are working</span> <span m="239240">on some sort of document--</span> <span
  m="243800">maybe a really important essay.</span></p><p><span m="246830">So this
  is my really important essay.</span></p><p><span m="251840">&quot;My essay on bugs
  by Andrew.&quot;</span> <span m="259600">So you''re working on this essay, you save
  the essay.</span></p><p><span m="271730">Then you make some changes, you save it
  again.</span></p><p><span m="282170">And then you''re like, oh, what was the first
  version</span> <span m="285470">of the essay I did?</span></p><p><span m="287330">It
  looks so different now.</span></p><p><span m="290330">So one of the things you''ll
  do is</span> <span m="291880">once you have a version you like,</span> <span m="302080">maybe
  you''ll take that version and let''s make a copy of it.</span></p><p><span m="311710">Let''s
  call it like v1--</span> <span m="313350">version 1.</span></p><p><span m="317826">Now
  let''s start working on version 2.</span></p><p><span m="320950">So if we mess something
  up, we still have the first version.</span></p><p><span m="334520">And then it''s
  getting really good.</span></p><p><span m="336460">So then at this point, we save
  our version 2.</span></p><p><span m="349110">Let''s call this one Final.</span></p><p><span
  m="361140">So as you work on multiple versions of the document,</span> <span m="365830">you
  want to save different versions in case you mess up.</span></p><p><span m="374479">You
  might have done that with an essay before.</span></p><p><span m="379300">You might
  submit an essay to professor.</span></p><p><span m="381707">They give you back a
  different version</span> <span m="383290">with corrected changes--</span> <span
  m="385840">an annotated version.</span></p><p><span m="388810">So version control
  in software is just a fancy way</span> <span m="392530">of saying the same thing--</span>
  <span m="394330">it''s making multiple versions of things</span> <span m="399940">that
  you can go back to and look at.</span></p><p><span m="404312">The thing with Git,
  though, is you don''t actually</span> <span m="407020">have to do what I just did.</span></p><p><span
  m="408550">It does all that automatically for you.</span></p><p><span m="420060">And
  that''s similar to--</span> <span m="422010">has anyone heard of Time Machine for
  your Apple?</span></p><p><span m="427500">Time Machine on OS X is software product
  that basically backs up</span> <span m="436050">your computer every hour, and then
  if something messes up,</span> <span m="439830">you can restore your computer to
  an earlier version.</span></p><p><span m="447700">It has a nice little interface
  like with a little time</span> <span m="450520">machine.</span></p><p><span m="451570">You
  can go back and look at previous versions</span> <span m="454750">of your computer.</span></p><p><span
  m="458960">GitHub is really similar.</span></p><p><span m="460930">It''s very similar,
  except it''s tuned for working well</span> <span m="466670">with source code, so
  it has a lot of other features</span> <span m="469909">that are useful for software
  developers.</span></p><p><span m="474740">So if you''re programming, eventually
  you</span> <span m="476990">will have to learn Git at some point.</span></p><p><span
  m="480140">And GitHub is like the most popular way</span> <span m="483710">of using
  Git, that''s why people treat them</span> <span m="487430">as almost the same thing.</span></p><p><span
  m="492610">So let''s take a look.</span></p><p><span m="495920">The way GitHub organizes
  things is</span> <span m="503012">it has these things called repositories.</span></p><p><span
  m="507370">And repository, you could think of it</span> <span m="510770">as like
  a folder or a project.</span></p><p><span m="515030">So every different project
  you''d want to different repository.</span></p><p><span m="518909">So for this course
  website we have one called mens-et-manus.</span></p><p><span m="536000">So where
  is that?</span></p><p><span m="540059">Ahh, here it is.</span></p><p><span m="546480">One
  of the things GitHub does is it provides this fancy home</span> <span m="550200">page
  for your projects, so you can document your projects</span> <span m="555000">on
  the homepage.</span></p><p><span m="563680">GitHub has a few ways of interacting
  with it.</span></p><p><span m="565830">You can look at your files from the web interface,
  GitHub.com.</span></p><p><span m="571140">There is also text-based interfaces</span>
  <span m="574510">and a visual interface of GitHub Desktop, which</span> <span m="578171">we''ll
  use shortly.</span></p><p><span m="583790">A few things to note.</span></p><p><span
  m="587100">So this is the current, latest version of your files.</span></p><p><span
  m="590040">This is a view of the latest version.</span></p><p><span m="596290">Unlike
  Time Machine, it doesn''t automatically</span> <span m="598800">create a new version
  every hour.</span></p><p><span m="603130">And if you used Dropbox, Dropbox creates</span>
  <span m="606940">a new version of your file every time you change it.</span></p><p><span
  m="610010">GitHub does not do that because it</span> <span m="615370">wants you
  to explicitly say when you''ve made a working change.</span></p><p><span m="620330">Because
  if you''re changing a piece of software,</span> <span m="623770">you might change
  three or four files</span> <span m="625790">until you have a working next version
  of your software.</span></p><p><span m="631090">So you basically have to tell Git</span>
  <span m="632890">every time you have a new version that works.</span></p><p><span
  m="637000">And that''s called the commit.</span></p><p><span m="638410">So the commits
  are basically the history</span> <span m="641960">of every time you''ve made a change
  and told GitHub about it</span> <span m="648400">AUDIENCE: Excuse me.</span></p><p><span
  m="649830">I would like to know if you made an account there</span> <span m="653670">and
  put the files for the course, uploaded them there.</span></p><p><span m="658790">ANDREW
  RINGLER: Yes.</span></p><p><span m="659880">Yes</span> <span m="660380">AUDIENCE:
  And if we sign, we can view this if we search for it.</span></p><p><span m="664682">Do
  we have to have access?</span></p><p><span m="666594">Do you have to give us access?</span></p><p><span
  m="668040">ANDREW RINGLER: I do, yes.</span></p><p><span m="670440">You''ll notice
  a few things.</span></p><p><span m="672390">There''s a little lock icon and there''s
  also</span> <span m="676500">this text that says &quot;private.&quot;</span> <span
  m="679908">So yes, until I add you, you will not</span> <span m="682350">be able
  to see this URL.</span></p><p><span m="687177">AUDIENCE: Are you going to?</span></p><p><span
  m="691110">ANDREW RINGLER: Twist my arm.</span></p><p><span m="692660">Yes.</span></p><p><span
  m="693160">AUDIENCE: No, I wonder if we are supposed</span> <span m="694868">to
  use anything in there.</span></p><p><span m="697350">ANDREW RINGLER: Yes, at some
  point</span> <span m="701790">I will ask you all to email me your GitHub user</span>
  <span m="705370">names and [INAUDIBLE].</span></p><p><span m="710210">OK.</span></p><p><span
  m="713460">So the commits are basically the history.</span></p><p><span m="715990">It''s
  good to name them well.</span></p><p><span m="717890">So I said, &quot;Link to electronic
  books and schedule.&quot;</span> <span m="727310">That''s when I added this schedule
  to the website.</span></p><p><span m="741450">&quot;Added a group project example&quot;--</span>
  <span m="743450">that was five hours ago.</span></p><p><span m="748710">So that''s
  when I added this example of group project.</span></p><p><span m="752380">So I basically
  made changes and notated the change.</span></p><p><span m="759590">So you can view
  the whole history of stuff on GitHub.</span></p><p><span m="764300">There''s also
  a ton of other features which we don''t use.</span></p><p><span m="768170">You could
  submit bug reports on their issues.</span></p><p><span m="771800">You can create
  a wiki for your project,</span> <span m="773690">which most people do not do.</span></p><p><span
  m="784200">All right.</span></p><p><span m="785610">The web interface-- you only
  really want</span> <span m="789420">to use it as a view of your files.</span></p><p><span
  m="791980">You don''t actually upload files there.</span></p><p><span m="796490">There
  is this Upload button and Create a New File button,</span> <span m="799230">but
  you don''t want to use that.</span></p><p><span m="803610">What we actually do want
  to use is this program</span> <span m="807000">called GitHub Desktop.</span></p><p><span
  m="812970">GitHub Desktop is similar to Dropbox.</span></p><p><span m="823310">Has
  anyone not heard of Dropbox?</span></p><p><span m="828040">Has anyone heard of Dropbox?</span></p><p><span
  m="830100">AUDIENCE: Yes.</span></p><p><span m="832600">ANDREW RINGLER: Yes, it
  had an IPO, it''s a big company.</span></p><p><span m="837070">So Dropbox-- yes,
  here you go.</span></p><p><span m="844410">So Dropbox has a few things.</span></p><p><span
  m="846170">It has a sleek little program that runs continuously.</span></p><p><span
  m="850950">And what it does is it takes a folder on your hard disk.</span></p><p><span
  m="861550">And any file you put in it, Dropbox</span> <span m="863660">will upload
  it to the cloud.</span></p><p><span m="866300">And if you have Dropbox on two computers,</span>
  <span m="868290">it will automatically sync them so you can</span> <span m="870270">have
  two folders look the same.</span></p><p><span m="873970">GitHub Desktop is very
  similar to that, except it does not</span> <span m="882270">do anything automatically.</span></p><p><span
  m="885450">If you drop files in a folder, it will detect them,</span> <span m="888450">but
  it won''t automatically push them up to the cloud.</span></p><p><span m="892240">You
  have to do that manually.</span></p><p><span m="895290">The reason is-- what I said
  before--</span> <span m="897560">is because you need to really make sure</span>
  <span m="901170">this is a change that won''t break the software,</span> <span m="904780">so
  forcing developers to write out the change,</span> <span m="917150">helps make the
  software easier to maintain.</span></p><p><span m="920410">OK, so in a moment--</span>
  <span m="929920">I''ll run through this quickly.</span></p><p><span m="936880">Let
  me tell you all the steps that have to happen.</span></p><p><span m="942500">In
  a moment, on your own, you will create an account</span> <span m="950910">on GitHub.com.</span></p><p><span
  m="952000">It''s a free account.</span></p><p><span m="952870">You can use any email
  address you want.</span></p><p><span m="957974">You''ll then download GitHub Desktop--</span>
  <span m="962080">that is also free software.</span></p><p><span m="975340">Once
  you''ve done that, you can log into GitHub Desktop</span> <span m="980150">and sync
  your cloud account with this piece of software locally.</span></p><p><span m="991620">Once
  you log in, you basically then</span> <span m="995140">choose which repositories
  you want to track.</span></p><p><span m="1000700">And to do that, we hit the Plus
  button, we say Clone.</span></p><p><span m="1017090">Then we search for the repository.</span></p><p><span
  m="1022130">We clone it.</span></p><p><span m="1025260">We choose a location to
  save it.</span></p><p><span m="1029108">I''ll run.</span></p><p><span m="1030021">through
  this really quickly and then</span> <span m="1031520">I''ll step back for everyone
  to do it.</span></p><p><span m="1038670">So what it''s doing, a clone is basically</span>
  <span m="1040510">making a copy of the repository.</span></p><p><span m="1042930">So
  there''s a version in my cloud at GitHub in California,</span> <span m="1048260">I
  guess.</span></p><p><span m="1049476">So we''re downloading that.</span></p><p><span
  m="1052550">Once we downloaded it, we could see a very similar view</span> <span
  m="1056450">to what we saw online.</span></p><p><span m="1059200">Here &quot;Link
  to electronic books and schedule&quot;--</span> <span m="1061310">that''s same thing
  we saw on the web page.</span></p><p><span m="1066690">We''ll say, &quot;No uncommitted
  changes.&quot;</span> <span m="1070730">Great.</span></p><p><span m="1072290">As
  I mentioned, if you drop a file in the folder--</span> <span m="1084540">GitHub
  Desktop has created this folder for me, just</span> <span m="1089010">like a normal
  folder.</span></p><p><span m="1092500">And these are all the files in it.</span></p><p><span
  m="1095860">So if we drag a new file into it, just like with Dropbox--</span> <span
  m="1102510">let''s drag up the final version of an essay.</span></p><p><span m="1106800">So
  I dragged it into our repository folder</span> <span m="1112130">locally on my hard
  drive.</span></p><p><span m="1115850">If we search back to GitHub Desktop,</span>
  <span m="1118190">it''s detected that change.</span></p><p><span m="1124250">Then
  we want to commit.</span></p><p><span m="1125940">So I said, &quot;Added my final
  essay version.&quot;</span> <span m="1131630">You always have to write out a commit
  message.</span></p><p><span m="1133670">It won''t let you commit without a message.</span></p><p><span
  m="1137860">So I said, &quot;Added final version.&quot;</span> <span m="1140500">I''ll
  say Commit.</span></p><p><span m="1145630">That actually committed locally on your
  computer.</span></p><p><span m="1151360">So it creates the whole history.</span></p><p><span
  m="1153390">Then we have to do another step--</span> <span m="1155040">sync-- which
