Overview
--------

Students form groups of four to six and work for twenty hours on a final project. We help facilitate this by discussing techniques for collaborative design, guiding the class in an improv activity, lead a brainstorming activity for the whole class to help students identify collaborators, allow students ample time to self-organize into teams. In addition, teams are provided with a $200 budget for buying hardware components that they would require apart from the components that we already have on our inventory. Students then have 20 hours of class time to develop an idea for a project, to create the project, and to prepare to present about their project in front of external visitors. The capstone of the class is a final five-minute presentation that each group must give about their project in front of the entire class and external visitors.

The following project demonstrations are courtesy of the participants, including MIT students, and used with permission.
